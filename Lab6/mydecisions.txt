For lab 6, I created an account on IFTTT and setup an automation to add a row to a Google Sheet each time an HTTP POST request was received from the ESP32 microcontroller. Due to the restriction of 3 values present in IFTTT, I combined the values for session ID and all 3 velocity values into "value 1". All the angle values were lumped into "value 2" and temperature was placed in "value 3".

I then setup a timer to interrupt every 1 minute and trigger an HTTP POST request through the urequests module (only if in demo mode). The HTTP POST request followed the format I found in a demonstration on IFTTT, which I tested by running the program for about 2 hours with no missed measurements or dropped requests. The test showed significant "run" in the measured values (likely due to low quality hardware and shoddy error correction in software), but the transmission of data worked perfectly.
