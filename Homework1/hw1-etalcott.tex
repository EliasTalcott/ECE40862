\section{Interest and Expectations}
I took interest in embedded systems during ECE 362. During my internship search, I looked for jobs relating to embedded systems, but found I was lacking in experience even for entry level positions. One thing that stood out to me was that nearly every job posting mentioned real-time operating systems and scheduling. These are subjects I would like to learn more about this semester.

After my internship this summer in software test engineering, I'm not sure if I still want to work in embedded systems. I really enjoyed test engineering and can see myself doing that long-term. However, I hope that this class will bring me back to embedded systems and spark my interest again.

\section{Fun Fact}
I compete in the sport of weightlifting. When I lived in Denmark last fall and winter, I had to opportunity to train the entire semester and lift in a meet with 3 members of the Danish national weightlifting team in a small gym north of Copenhagen. This year, assuming we are able to have competitions, I plan to lift in the American Open Finals in Atlanta, Georgia.
